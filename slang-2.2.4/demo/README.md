Programmer's Interactive Editor
===============================

Emacs-like Erlang editor fully written in Erlang with S-Lang driver.
It is refined and ready to run on R16B01 with built-in sync and lager.
Pie codebase is very tiny, clean and extendable.

Run
---

    $ rebar get-deps
    $ rebar compile
    $ ./pie README.md

CUA mode
--------

Pie suports Extended Kystrokes and CUA mode being general purpose
editor saving your hands from RSI.

    CURSOR            -- Navigation
    HOME (Fn-LEFT)    -- Begining of line
    END  (Fn-RIGHT)   -- End of line
    PGUP (Fn-UP)      -- Page up
    PGDN (Fn-DOWN)    -- Page down

Selection
    
    S-CURSOR    -- Selection
    C-S-LEFT    -- Begining of line
    C-S-RIGHT   -- End of line
    M-S-LEFT    -- Word left
    M-S-RIGHT   -- Word right

Selection CUA mode caveats due to Linux Terminal limitations
    
    C-S-UP/DN   -- unbinded
    S-PGUP/PGDN -- unbinded
    
Copy & Paste

    M-c -- Copy
    M-v -- Paste

Remember that Pie is an Emacs (Erlang Macros) editor thus
it supports all basic Emacs commands which you can find
in edit_globalmap bindings. Here are most important:

File Operations
---------------

    C-x C-c -- Quit
    C-x C-f -- Find File, supports autocompletion in popup-windows
    C-x C-s -- Save File

Window Management
-----------------

    C-x o -- Next Window
    C-x 0 -- Delete selected Window
    C-x 1 -- Delete other Windows
    C-x 2 -- Vertical Split 
    
Pie Commands
------------

    M-x --  will run internal Pie command in module:function format.
            E.g. you can type "edit_lib:scroll_up"

For developing Pie commands a parse_transform syntax was introduced.
Here is example of edit_lib:unix_command

    -command({unix_command, [{shell_command, "Shell command:"}]}).
    unix_command(State, Cmd) ->
        Text = os:cmd(["sh -c '(cd ",edit_util:pwd(State)," ; ",Cmd,")'"]),
        edit_util:popup_message(State, '*Shell Command Output*', Text).

State is mandatory first argument of Pie state.

Eval
----

"M-:" command will evaluate Erlang Expression in the minibuffer,
like "os:type()." or "lists:seq(1,100).". If output is not fit into
one line another window will be created.

Interactive Mode
----------------

    C-x i --  command will enter Erlang Interactive shell 
              where you can evaluate Erlang expressions 
              inside editor buffer by pressing ENTER on them.
              The result would be displayed also in the 
              editor buffer below.

                    os:type(). ENTER
                    => {unix,linux}
                    >>

Fundamental Mode
----------------

    C-x f -- command will bring you back to Fundamental mode which
             is defaul editing mode.

Erlang Mode
-----------

    C-x e -- command will dive you into Erlang mode which helps you edit Erlang code.
    C-i   -- reformat selected code

Futher tasks

* UTF-8
