The documentation here is provided in text format.  Documentation in
SGML, HTML, TeX, and postscript formats are also available from
ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/slang-doc.tar.gz as well as the
mirror sites.  In addition, the documentation is available on-line from
http://space.mit.edu/%7Edavis/slang-doc.html.

The text subdirectory contains:

   text/slang.txt    Documentation describing the slang language
   text/cslang.txt   C programmer's guide to the library
   text/cref.txt     Reference Manual for the C functions
   text/slangfun.txt Reference Manual for the slang intrinsic functions

There may be additional subdirectories:

   tm/               Text-Macro source for documentation
   html/             Documentation in HTML form
   text/             Documentation in text form
   ps/               Documentation in postscript (from LaTeX)
   sgml/             SGML source

The documentation was created by SGML-Tools from SGML format, which
itself was created from text-macro source.  The LaTeX2e output
produced by SGML-Tools needs some additional tweaking by the script
tm/fixtex.sl.
