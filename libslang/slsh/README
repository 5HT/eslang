slsh (slang-shell) is a work in progress.  See the scripts/
subdirectory for some trivial examples of its use.

Usage: slsh [OPTIONS] [[-|file] [args ...]]
 --help           Print this help
 --version        Show slsh version information
 -g               Compile with debugging code, tracebacks, etc
 -n               Don't load personal init file
 -i init-file     Use this file instead of default
 -v               Show verbose loading messages

Along with the slsh executable, the files lib/slsh.rc and lib/*.sl
will also get installed.

Upon startup, the program will try to load slsh.rc as follows:

   If either SLSH_CONF_DIR or SLSH_LIB_DIR environment variables
   exist, then look in the corresponding directories for slsh.rc.
   Otherwise look in:

       $(prefix)/etc       (specified in Makefile)
       /usr/local/etc/
       /usr/local/etc/slsh/
       /etc/
       /etc/slsh/

The slsh.rc file may load other files from slsh's library directory in
the manner described below.  

Once slsh.rc is loaded, slsh will load $HOME/.slshrc if present.
Finally, it will load the script specified on the command line.  If
the name of the script is "-", then it will be read from stdin.

When a script loads a file via the built-in "evalfile" function or the
"require" function (autoloaded by slsh.rc), the file is searched for
along the SLSH_PATH as specified in the Makefile.  An alternate path
may be specified by the SLSH_PATH environment variable.

The search path may be queried and set during run time via set the
get_lib_path and set_lib_path functions, e.g.,

   set_lib_path ("/home/bill/lib/slsh:/usr/share/slsh");
